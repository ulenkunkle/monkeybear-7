Ultimately, Palpatine won the election for Supreme Chancellor. However, the Federation 
army was defeated, Gunray was captured by Amidala's forces, and Maul met his
 presumed death at the hands of the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, though not before striking 
 down Qui-Gon Jinn, whose funeral Palpatine would later attend. Palpatine also learned
 that the Naboo owed their victory to the unexpected intervention of Anakin Skywalker,
 a young, freed slave from Tatooine who was highly attuned to the Force, fueling the 
 belief that he was the Chosen One of Jedi prophecy who would bring balance to the Force. 
 After much debate, the Jedi Council decided that Skywalker would be apprenticed to Kenobi
 as a Jedi. Palpatine personally congratulated the two Jedi during the celebration on Naboo, 
 telling young Skywalker that his career would be watched with "great interest".[1]
