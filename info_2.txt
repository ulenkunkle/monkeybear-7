Over the next ten years,[20] Supreme Chancellor Palpatine amassed a favorable reputation as a 
mild-mannered servant of the common good, and the public remained oblivious to his true, insidious
persona. As Anakin Skywalker grew older, his relationship with Palpatine deepened; on many
occasions, Palpatine lauded Skywalker as the most gifted Jedi he had ever encountered, one who 
would surpass even Yoda, the Grand Master of the Jedi Council. Skywalker, who grew increasingly
frustrated with the strict lifestyle of the Jedi under his master Kenobi's guidance, admired 
Palpatine's praise and greatly took to his counsel. In truth, this was all part of Sidious' plan to gain
Skywalker's trust and groom him into his new Sith apprentice.[5][8]With Maul's defeat, Sidious
found himself in need of a new apprentice, and so he turned to Dooku to fill that role. Dooku 
left the Jedi Order, reclaiming his wealth and title as the Count of Serenno.[18] With the turn
of Dooku—anointed Darth Tyranus—the Sith orchestrated the death of Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas
and took over his clientele for the commission of a clone army produced on Kamino; the event
was subsequently covered up when Dooku erased all records of Kamino from the Jedi Archives.
[21] Subsequently, bounty hunter Jango Fett was hired as the clones' genetic template, and the
clones were fitted with a bio-chip containing a protocol that would ensure their total obedience to 
Sidious when the time came for it.
