Upon arriving in Coruscant to vote on the matter, Palpatine's successor as Senator of Naboo, former
 Queen Padm√© Amidala, narrowly avoided an assassination attempt carried out by Zam Wesell on 
 behalf of the vengeful Nute Gunray. Palpatine had the vote delayed and placed the senator under the 
 protection of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, her old allies from the Battle of Naboo.
 After a second attempt on the senator's life was made, Skywalker was assigned to protect her back
 on her homeworld of Naboo. There the two secretly started to fall in love which, coupled with
 Skywalker's later discovery of his mother Shmi's death at the hands of Tusken Raiders on the planet
 Tatooine, would bring the young Jedi ever closer to the dark side of the force, and even more vulnerable
 to Sidious' deceptive machinations.[8]
However, when it was revealed that the Separatists were secretly building a battle droid army, Palpatine
used the situation to have himself granted emergency powers from the Senate by Representative 
Jar Jar Binks. Palpatine feigned reluctance to accept this authority, promising to return it to the Senate
 once the crisis ended. His first act was to allow the use of the clone army, which was discovered by
 Kenobi on Kamino, to counter the Separatist threat; this resulted in the Battle of Geonosis, which
 served as the opening salvo of the Clone Wars. After clone template Jango Fett was killed and the
 Separatist partners escaped the battle, Dooku met with Sidious with not only good news that the 
 war the Sith had been orchestrating had begun, but with plans for a Geonosian superweapon that 
 may be of use for their future Sith-led regime. Sidious was pleased with these turn of events, and later 
 with the leaders of the Senate oversaw the new Republic army marching towards war, while Skywalker
 and Amidala secretly wed on Naboo with their two droids C-3PO and R2-D2 as witnesses, which Sidious
 would later use as an advantage to lure Skywalker to become his next apprentice.[8]
