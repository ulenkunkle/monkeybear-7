Thirteen years before his Imperial ascent, Sidious engineered the Invasion of Naboo and used the 
political crisis as a pretext to being elected Supreme Chancellor by the Galactic Senate.
 With Maul's defeat at the hands of the Jedi, Sidious was in need of a new apprentice. 
 Dooku left the Jedi Order and was bestowed the title "Darth Tyranus" by Sidious. 
 Together, they formed the Confederacy of Independent Systems to spark a galactic civil war. 
 As Chancellor Palpatine, Sidious was given sweeping central, emergency powers
 to handle the Separatist crisis, and he raised the Grand Army of the Republic to
 fight the Clone Wars. The clone troopers in the Grand Army had been secretly commissioned
 by the Sith, and each contained a bio-chip with a preprogrammed protocol to eliminate the Jedi,
 the sworn enemies of the Sith, when the order was given.

At the war's end, Sidious had gained almost total control over the Republic. 
With his new power, Sidious branded the Jedi as traitors and ordered the clones to execute 
Order 66, thus destroying the Jedi Order. With the Jedi destroyed, Sidious declared himself 
Emperor and transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire. Sidious also turned Jedi Knight 
Anakin Skywalker, the Chosen One, to the dark side and anointed him Darth Vader
. Over the next several years, Sidious transferred the daily management of the Empire to a 
Ruling Council and spent much of his time in an ancient Sith shrine beneath the Imperial Palace
, attempting to use the dark side to reshape the Force to his own ends. .
